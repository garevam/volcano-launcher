# volcano-launcher
Volcano is a launcher for the personal wiki software Obsidian. The purpose of Volcano is to make it easier to open Obsidian with a
specific vault (wiki).
The default Obsidian launcher is tailored to users with a single vault (through the function to automatically open the last used vault),
or users who regularly switch between 4-5 vaults (through the recently opened function). Any vault not "recently" accessed is forgotten
and must be reselected manually. There is no support for users who prefer to keep separate vaults for different purposes and only rarely
access some of them. Volcano should bridge that gap, allowing quick access to all vaults.

Obsidian is currently under active development, which might break compatibility.
Volcano is compatible with Obsidian 1.4.13 and should work on any modern Windows release.

Built with Python.
Tested on Windows 10.

> How does it work?

(fill in)
The program could have been built in a simpler way, but I thought it was important to allow the possibility of 
closing it without applying any changes to obsidian.json

> Limitations

Volcano assumes that all vaults are in the same folder. It doesn't support multiple locations.

> Future development possibilities

- Creation of new vaults
- Possibility to handle a different file system

> What did I learn?

Sadly the pun doesn't work. Obsidian is usually created by rapidly cooling, high-silica lava that's already been thrown out by the volcano,
so volcanoes don't actually launch obsidian. A major flaw in an otherwise functional program.
